# Drug Solubility Prediction based on calculated molecular descriptors via Mordred

This is a collection neural network model to predict aqueous drug-like molecules based molecular descriptors calculated by Mordred (https://github.com/mordred-descriptor/mordred). Mordred has the capability to 1613 kinds of molecular descriptors. Several models are built based on the selection of molecular descriptors. 5 sets of molecular descriptors are selected for Pearson Correlation Coefficient between molecular descriptors and aqueous solubility larger than 0.8, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3 and 0.0 separately.
